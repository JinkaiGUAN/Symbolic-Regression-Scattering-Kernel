In this folder, all the data and jupyter notebook focus on specular-kernel. Here are some points you need to keep in mind.

1. The data are created usieng fully Maxwellian-type kernel, and the accommodation coefficient are determined by our self, most of time, it is default as 0.5.

2. Then we are going to use Symbolic Regression to test if it is possible to retrieve the equation from the data. 

3. There are two jupyter notebooks needed attention, i.e. using postfix with Sharp. Thses two files use functions more like Dirac-Delta function, and for the function set, we are not going to use some variabels like, 1000, but using 1/0.001 instead.
