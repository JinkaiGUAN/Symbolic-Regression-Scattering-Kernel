# Symbolic-Regression-Scattering-Kernel
This is a project using DEAP to build self-made evolutionary program, and utilise such framework to distil symbolic mathematical expression from fluid dynamics data, i.e., scattering kernel. 

The SK_Data folder constains all molecular dynamics data used in this project. 

The util.py is the helper function python file to help us extract SK_Data. Be careful to use this helper function due to the confuing the path in python.
