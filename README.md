# Symbolic-Regression-Scattering-Kernel
This is a project using DEAP to build self-made evolutionary program, and utilise such framework to distil symbolic mathematical expression from fluid dynamics data, i.e., scattering kernel.  However, the work are all stored in the master branch due to the github problem when push the files. Sorry for it.
