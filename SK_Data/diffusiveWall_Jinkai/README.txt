Hi Jinkai,

Here is a group of data describe the characteristic of a completely diffusive wall at a temperature 423K, i.e., the reflected velocity distribution will follow the Maxwellian Distriution for any incident velocities. As you might see, we define the initial velocities of all the molecules as vx = 50, vy = 10, vz = 10 m/s.  

3_meas_velocities_top.txt: contains the velocity vectors for all the molecules when they enter and leave the record plane.                                               
The file follows the order:         vxStart, vyStart, vzStart, vxEnd, vyEnd, vzEnd 


Other files are the reflected velocity distributions for normal direction, tangential direction, etc. The first colume of these files is the velocity magnitude, the second colume is the number of molecules, while the third colume is the probability.
